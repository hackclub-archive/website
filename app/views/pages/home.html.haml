        %span.h3 hackEDU 
        is a non-profit initiative that works with high school students to start
        and lead programming clubs at their schools. We provide all the tools for
        starting and leading clubs including a baseline coding curriculum, free
        software tools, and community building training.
      %p
        Each club typically spans the school year, regularly meeting weekly or
        biweekly for between one and several hours. Clubs are led by high school
        hackers who want to bring the hackathon culture back to their schools.

      %h3 Why hackEDU?
      %p
        Instead of focusing on teaching a set curriculum at hack clubs, hackEDU
        focuses on building all-inclusive families where members build things
        together. This results in: (1) hack clubs engaging groups that are
        underrepresented in computer science and attracting members who might not
        normally sign up for computer science classes, and (2) building
        confidence, courage, and skills in members through integration with the
        broader hacking community.

      %h4 What our hackers have been up to
      %p
        :markdown
          At the top two collegiate hackathons in the world, [PennApps
          X](http://2014f.pennapps.com/) and [MHacks
          V](http://mhacksv.challengepost.com/), half of the six winning teams
          were led high school students. All of these winning high school teams
          are part of hackEDU.

          Most recently, [Rohith Varanasi](http://rohithvaranasi.com/), one of
          our club leaders from South Brunswick High School, and the rest of his
          team from [MHacks IV](http://mhacks-iv.challengepost.com/) were named
          the [Major League Hacking + Thiel 2014 Rookie of the
          Year](http://news.mlh.io/cosmos-thiel-rookie-year-2014-mlh-fall-season-02-09-2015)
          for creating [Cosmos
          Browser](http://www.androidauthority.com/cosmos-browser-sms-data-connection-526654/).
          Another one of our leaders, [Raphael Kats](http://raphaelrk.com/),
          created [DataWave](http://challengepost.com/software/datawave), another
          data-less browser using radio waves at MHacks V and won 2nd place.

        %span.header Hack Club
        is a non-profit initiative that works with high school students to
        start and lead programming clubs at their schools. We provide all the
        tools for starting and leading clubs including a baseline coding
        curriculum, free software tools, and community building training.
      %p
        Each club typically spans the school year, regularly meeting weekly or
        biweekly. Clubs are led by high school hackers who want to bring the
        hackathon culture back to their schools. No previous coding experience
        is required.
      %h3 Why Hack Club?
      %p
        Instead of focusing on teaching a set curriculum at hack clubs, Hack Club
        focuses on building all-inclusive families where members build things
        together. This results in: (1) hack clubs engaging groups that are
        underrepresented in computer science and attracting members who might
        not normally sign up for computer science classes, and (2) building
        confidence, courage, and skills in members through integration with the
        broader hacking community.
      %h3 What is hacking?
      %p
        Although the media has projected negative connotations onto the idea of
        hacking, we only use it in its most positive definition: figuring out
        creative solutions to problems that we all face.

        "This is my club's first year and it's been leaps and bounds better than
        expected. Over the course of the year, our more than 80 members have
        made games and websites, participated in hackathons, and have
        volunteered at a local middle school for their Hour of Code. I started
        my club after talking to Hack Club and can say it wouldn't be a reality
        if they weren't around."
